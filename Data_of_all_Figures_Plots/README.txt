######   Folder and File Structures   ######


The File 'Figures_1_6_data.opju' is an Origin File. It contains all data that corresponds to the plots presented in Figure 1 to Figure 6 as well as the necessary plotting scripts. This enables other research to fully reproduce our plots and finding presented in the manuscript. 

The file 'Figures_1_6_data.opju'  can be accessed using the Origin software from OriginLab (https://www.originlab.com/) and the recommended version is 2022b. 

Further, the folder 'Figure7' contains the numpy array and the Python script for plotting the quantized and unquantized weights of the LeNET and VGG8 network, which correspond to Figure 7 presented in the manuscript "First Demonstration of In-Memory Computing Crossbar using Multi-level Cell FeFET".
